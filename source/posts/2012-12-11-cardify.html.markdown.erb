# Cardify!!!

So I had a client that had a particular need to print out recipe sized cards in the dimensions of 3x5, 4x6, etc... Oh yeah, and I needed to be done within 40 hours.  So there I was wondering what the hell I was going to do to produce this type of output within a normal work week. Since I'm a frontend developer, I immediately thought of a client-side solution.  But then I was trying to figure out how I was going to break content apart and overflow that content into multiple sections... dynamically.

## Idea 1

We'll use the 3x5 cards as a base example for this. My first idea was to consume a block of content with javascript and calculate the targeted width and height of the 3x5 card and that would get me the number of cards I needed and then clone the content into each card and offset the content like so:
