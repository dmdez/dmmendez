    <summary type="html">&lt;h1 id='cardify'&gt;Cardify!!!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had a client that had a particular need to print out recipe sized cards in the dimensions of 3x5, 4x6, etc&amp;#8230; Oh yeah, and I needed to be done within 40 hours. So there I was wondering what the hell I was going to do to produce this type of output within a normal work week. Since I&amp;#8217;m a frontend developer, I immediately thought of a client-side solution. But then I was trying to figure out how I was going to break content apart and overflow that content into multiple sections&amp;#8230; dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;h2 id='idea_1'&gt;Idea 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll use the 3x5 cards as a base example for this. My first idea was to consume a block of content with javascript and calculate the targeted width and height of the 3x5 card and that would get me the number of cards I needed and then clone the content into each card and offset the content like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='' src='/images/cardify-example1.png' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;This is a code sample - we&amp;#39;ll try and make it longer to see if it breaks&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
